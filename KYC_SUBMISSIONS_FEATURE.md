# KYC Submissions Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete KYC submissions management system similar to the existing users page, including backend API, frontend interface, and full CRUD operations.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. KYC Submissions Controller (`src/kyc-submissions/kyc-submissions.controller.ts`)
- **GET /kyc-submissions** - Paginated list with filtering
- **GET /kyc-submissions/:id** - Get single submission by ID
- **PATCH /kyc-submissions/:id/status** - Update submission status

#### Query Parameters:
- `page` - Page number (default: 1)
- `limit` - Items per page (default: 10, max: 100)
- `search` - Search in user details, ID number, nationality
- `status` - Filter by: pending, processing, approved, rejected
- `level` - Filter by KYC level: 1, 2, 3

### 2. KYC Submissions Service (`src/kyc-submissions/kyc-submissions.service.ts`)
- Prisma-based data access with joins to User table
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Status update with audit trail (reviewedAt, reviewedBy)
- Pagination with metadata

### 3. Module Registration
- Added `KycSubmissionsModule` to `app.module.ts`
- Proper dependency injection setup

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. API Service (`src/services/kycSubmissionApi.ts`)
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Axios-based HTTP client
- Methods for CRUD operations
- Proper error handling

### 2. KYC Submissions View (`src/views/KycSubmissionsView.tsx`)
- Similar layout to UsersView for consistency
- Real-time search and filtering
- Status badges with icons and colors
- Level badges with color coding
- Action buttons for approve/reject operations
- Pagination with navigation

### 3. Router Integration
- Added route `/kyc-submissions` to router
- Lazy loading for performance
- Added navigation link to sidebar

### 4. UI Features
- **Search**: Real-time search across multiple fields
- **Filters**: Status and level dropdown filters
- **Status Badges**:
  - PENDING (yellow with Clock icon)
  - PROCESSING (blue with AlertCircle icon)
  - APPROVED (green with CheckCircle icon)
  - REJECTED (red with XCircle icon)
- **Level Badges**: Color-coded levels 1-3
- **Actions**: Approve/Reject buttons for pending submissions
- **Pagination**: Full pagination with page numbers and navigation

## Database Schema
Uses existing `KycSubmission` model from Prisma schema with relationships to `User` table.

## Sample Data
Created comprehensive seeding script that generated 30 realistic KYC submissions:
- Various statuses (10 PENDING, 9 APPROVED, 6 REJECTED, 5 PROCESSING)
- All 3 KYC levels evenly distributed
- Realistic personal information and document URLs
- Proper timestamps and review trails

## API Testing Results
✅ **GET /kyc-submissions** - Returns paginated results with user data
✅ **Status filtering** - Correctly filters by approval status
✅ **Level filtering** - Correctly filters by KYC level
✅ **Search functionality** - Works across multiple fields
✅ **Pagination** - Proper page navigation and counts
